# FO4_xEdit_Stuff

Some scripts/functions made for FO4Edit https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/

GS_Utilities has a bunch of functions which are useful when xEdit scripting. Descriptions of all functions can be found in desc file. 

GS_SimplifiedSorting_AutoPatcher is an auto patcher for Simplified Sorting mod for Fallout4. Will tidy it up to use GS_Utilities soon.
